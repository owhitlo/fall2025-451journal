  p1: 'Reflect on the metaphor introduced at the beginning of the chapter: walking into a conversation that’s already underway. Have you ever had that experience in real life (in class, online, or at work)? What happened when you did—or didn’t—take the time to listen first? How does that scenario relate to the role of the literature review in research? Why is it important to understand what’s already been said before adding your ideas?'
  p2: 'Think about a media-related topic that interests you (e.g., influencer culture, video game violence, media portrayals of mental health). Now imagine you are preparing to write a literature review on that topic. What kind of “gap” would you look for to justify a new study? Would it be a topical void, a contradiction, or an overlooked perspective? Why does that kind of gap matter in media research?'
  p3: 'In your own words, explain the difference between an annotated bibliography and a proper literature review. Why is that difference significant? Reflect on a time when you had to summarize multiple sources for a paper or project. Did you organize those sources thematically, or treat each one individually? Looking ahead, how will your approach change when writing your literature review?'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->
An annotated bibliography is basically sources with a short explanation for each of them. On the other hand, a literature review is more about giving a larger view, maybe even like storytelling, about the research and how the sources connect, including themes and things of that sort. I would say it’s much more detailed and involved than an annotated bibliography.

Honestly, I can’t remember a time I summarized multiple sources. I am kind of used to academic journal writing, basically letting all of the citations do the talking and adding a bit of my own details. I guess, if I had to relate it to this, maybe when researching for a presentation? Going through multiple sources to first understand the information, make sure it lines up with others, and then trying to put it in my own words in a way that makes sense to me. I would say, regardless, I organize them thematically — it just makes the most sense and keeps everything organized on the document and in my head.

I think organization is the best way to take on any long writing endeavor. I personally like to use one document for everything or a note on my computer so everything is in one space, using red text to separate things I need to fix, work on or just notes. But at this moment, I can’t think of anything I would do differently to do a review more succinctly.
