  p1: 'Think of a broad media-related topic you’ve been curious about—something like influencer culture, algorithmic feeds, or news bias. Now, imagine you’re preparing to research this topic. Would you start with a research question or a hypothesis? Why? Reflect on how much you already know (or don’t know) about the topic, and how that affects whether exploration or prediction is the better fit.'
  p2: 'This chapter outlines five criteria for strong research questions and hypotheses: clarity, grounding in literature, researchability, clear identification of variables or phenomena, and significance. Choose one of these criteria and explain why it seems especially important to you as a beginner researcher. Then, critique a question or hypothesis (real or imagined) that fails to meet this criterion. What makes it fall short?'
  p3: 'The chapter emphasized that your research question or hypothesis should directly shape the method you choose. Why do you think that connection is so important? Choose one method (e.g., experiment, interview, content analysis) and describe what kind of research question or hypothesis best fits that method. Use your own topic or one discussed in the chapter as an example.'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->
If I was preparing a media related research topic, for this sake, influencer culture, I think I would begin with a research question.

A research question is more open ended, it’s more broad, which also makes sense for a topic that is still new in many ways and constantly changing, evolving. Influencers hold an immense amount of power. They shape trends and industries, are able to build personal connections unlike other models that allow them to persuade on more than just products or services, but social issues we are now seeing. While I feel like I have a decent grasp on the topic, I still don’t think I know enough to confidently make a prediction at the very beginning.

Starting with a hypothesis would mean having a specific expectation already in mind, which I don’t — like “influencers directly increase a consumer’s trust in products.” That kind of prediction assumes I already have a strong base of knowledge about influencer culture and how it operates. But, I only know general things, not enough to jump straight into testing specific things.

So, by starting with a research question, I can dig deeper into areas I don’t fully understand yet. A question like “How do influencers shape audience trust in products?” or “What role do influencers play in shaping foreseeable trends?” helps as a sort of guide for the research while letting actual facts speak for itself if that makes sense.
