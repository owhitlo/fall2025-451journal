  p1: 'Think about a variable you’ve seen reported often—something like income, grades, or social media followers. Was it reported as an average (mean)? Do you think that number accurately reflected the “typical” case? Based on what you learned in this chapter, would another measure of central tendency (median or mode) have been more appropriate? Why?'
  p2: 'Describe a time when a graph or chart helped you understand something better than a list of numbers could. What did the visual help reveal? Based on this chapter, which principle of good visualization do you think was at work? If you’ve seen a bad graph or misleading chart, describe that too—and explain what could have made it clearer.'
  p3: 'The chapter describes descriptive analysis as a “first conversation” with your data. Why is it essential to fully describe your sample before jumping to conclusions or testing hypotheses? How might skipping this step lead to bad research or misleading claims?'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->
I would say always — regardless of the circumstance — a graph or chart helps me understand something better than numbers alone. I’ve never really been someone who can just look at a list of numbers (or anything math related) and instantly grasp what they mean, if that makes sense. When information is visualized, I’m able to decipher it quicker and easier. For example, in my criminal justice class the other week, we did a coin flip test with the entire class. The professor wrote all the results on the board in a long line of numbers. Not only did it feel disorganized, but it also made it hard to see any sort of pattern. It would have been much easier to understand if it had been displayed as a bar graph or scatterplot showing the frequencies and distribution of results.

Regarding the principle of good visualization, I’d say clarity was at play? For me, a good visual is organized so the information is immediately clear and easy on the eyes. I can’t recall a bad graph or misleading chart, but a pie chart that adds up to over 100% or uses too many thin slices would probably fall under “bad,” or at least unhelpful.
