  p1: 'Think about a time when you were asked to take a survey—maybe in a class, at work, or online. Did any of the questions confuse you, feel biased, or leave you without an option that reflected your honest opinion? Describe one such moment. What made the question problematic, and how might you rewrite it to improve it?'
  p2: 'Imagine you''re designing a survey for your research project. What would be the central question your survey aims to answer? List two variables you’d want to measure and describe one closed-ended and one open-ended question you would include to help you do so. Why did you choose each format?'
  p3: 'Why do you think people often ignore or skip surveys? From your perspective as both a respondent and future researcher, what strategies would make you more likely to complete a survey? How do your answers shape the way researchers must think about sampling and nonresponse?'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->
I think people often ignore or skip surveys because they feel it’s pointless or just a waste of time. A lot of surveys are long, tedious or repetitive, and it’s easy to want to call it quits after a few boring minutes. I also think some people worry about privacy, especially when a survey claims to be anonymous but asks for your personal information. For many, it might also be that they feel their opinion doesn’t matter or that they don’t know enough about the topic for their response to be helpful.

From my perspective as both a respondent and a future researcher, the biggest thing that would make me more likely to complete a survey is simplicity. Keeping it short, clear and to the point makes a big difference. Incentives help too, even something small like being entered into a $15 gift card drawing can go a long way. I also think a survey that looks clean, professional and is easy to navigate or access makes people more likely to finish it.

If a survey is too long or boring, certain kinds of people might not respond, which can make the results less accurate. Because of that, researchers need to do what they can to make surveys engaging and easy to complete. They also need to make sure they are reaching out to enough people and making sure different types of participants are represented.

<!-- RESPONSE-END -->
