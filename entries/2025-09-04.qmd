  p1: 'Think of a media-related issue or question you find interesting (e.g., misinformation on social media, representation in film, streaming habits). Now imagine researching that issue without using any theory—just collecting facts. What would be missing from your findings? Reflect on how theory might deepen or improve your ability to explain or understand the issue. What questions might theory help you ask?'
  p2: 'After reading about the social scientific, interpretive, and critical/cultural paradigms, which approach feels most aligned with how you think about research, or how you want to think about it? Why? Share a media topic you care about and describe how your chosen paradigm would shape your research questions, methods, and the kind of insights you might produce.'
  p3: 'Pick one communication theory mentioned in this chapter (e.g., Cultivation Theory, Social Comparison Theory, Feminist Theory). Briefly describe how this theory interprets a real-world communication problem (e.g., violence in media, body image, online harassment). Then reflect on how your understanding of the issue changes when seen through that theoretical lens. What does the theory help you notice that you might not have otherwise?'

## Response

<!-- RESPONSE-START -->
A media-related issue I find interesting and have considered writing about in the newspaper is how diversity is currently being displayed in movies and shows. Many of times, it feels like filmmakers and showrunners add a “diverse” character to check some sort of box or put them as a side character instead of writing them real, meaningful parts. If I were to research this without any theory, I would probably be collecting a lot of numbers. Such as, the ratio of diversity among casts, how many characters are from such and such backgrounds, but other than that, I am not sure what else can be done. The bigger picture would be what’s missing. How does that representation come across to audiences? Do they feel a certain movie or TV show had meaningful diversity or did it seem forced? Is said person a part of said diverse group? Without theory, there wouldn’t be a way to explain how people respond or the impact of what they are watching. Theory can help ask and explain how authentic representation might change how an audience connects with a piece of media and how stories are told. It can also raise questions like why do some portrayals feel forced, how “token” characters effect the viewing experience and what role does culture or the industry play in shaping the representation we see. Using theory allows for the research to go beyond just counting and instead actually showing the effects of diversity on audiences and storytelling.
